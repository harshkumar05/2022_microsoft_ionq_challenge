# Stranger-Ducks
iQuHack 2022 project
**Who we are**

Hello Quack Quack !!!
Its StrangeDucks 

So, hackers, you must have been working for a long session do you get tired exhausted but don't wanna give up your as valuable as gold time. How about a game made by co-hacker 

Now must be thinking of playing a game in middle for such strict clock ticking is it any trick from our side to indulge you in a game and distract you from work no-no definitely not. What if I tell you that you can learn more about QC via this game and later apply it to your projects now sounds interesting well in my thoughts it is, also this is a small present from our side so you might remember us and good time during the hack.

**Principal**  

This game was implemented using python programming language and quantum support environment qiskit. So how you do play it, you are a small duck just swimming in the ocean of qubits and you have to collect some required numbers of qubits (generated using quantum random number generator) to win the game. Looks easy why don't we twist it a bit but how? let me take you to the dark side of the game a parallel world as soon you start playing you'll be getting positive qubits realising randomly from a point and you have to move in that 2d plane to collect the qubits but you must take care of quantum wells “it can turn your world upside down” as of now you were having a target score your current score and positive qubits but in the parallel world you will have negative qubits which will reduce your current score and make the things difficult for you but we will still give you chance to win we ll have quantum wells in parallel sides also which can take to you the positive world where you will have positive qubits and a chance to win.

**How to play**

Now you are familiar with the storyline of the game and might be inserted to play the game and win it then let's get you some instruction. 


The game is in a 2D plane
In the main or positive world, qubits will be appearing away from you and will be rare and quantum well will be appearing randomly and frequently you can use the arrow key to collect qubits and avoid quantum well by jumping.
Unlike in a parallel or negative world, negative values qubits will be fired at you frequently and quantum will be rare.
Your goal is to get a score equal to or greater than the target score as soon as you achieve this you win.




**Future Scopes and Development** 

Games always trigger curiosity our main goal is to make is the educational purpose for teaching quantum computing currently it is the light version in the upcoming version we ll make it a 3D game and build with Unity and unreal engine also will be adding Gennie who ask complex or tricky not hard questions in form of puzzles and phrase related to quantum computing and also ask them to implement and solve a circuit-related problem we will be using quantum machine learning for the implementation and have a different level and multiple universes(practice, circuit, theory & others )if you solve 3 wrong in a row you will be sent to these universes and there you have to learn and get trained form your master of the particular universe  and do the task allotted by them and collect points  in order to playback again
